## Notice
We ("exorium team") will not accept unmodified code, or barely modified code coming directly from other (open source) bots. We have a strict policy on that. We do not have a clear list of points which need to be modified adjustingly on code from other bots, however there is a list of things you must **not** remove from this code. The rest of this is up to user discretion and exorium team. The list goes as follows:
- You may NOT remove any signs to the other bot/author from the code:
    1. This includes the name of the bot(s).
    2. Any type of image, file or such signalling to the bot(s).
    3. Any reference to the bot(s).
    4. Names of original author(s)
    5. References to original author(s).
    6. Links, or others to the orginal author(s) (profiles)
- You may not remove any parts of the command that make it functional.
